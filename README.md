Project 1 – Retail Transaction Analysis Project - The project involves analyzing day-to-day transactions of a retail store and keeping track of customers and their purchases/returns across various categories. The data includes information on customers, transactions, and product hierarchy. The goal is to create a report with calculated metrics, reports, and inferences. The tasks involve merging datasets, preparing summary reports, generating histograms and frequency tables, and answering specific questions such as identifying popular product categories among male and female customers, which store type sells the maximum products, and how many customers have more than 10 unique transactions. The project aims to optimize business processes, generate profits, and satisfy customer expectations through data-driven insights.



Project 2 – Credit Card Analytics and Customer Behaviour Analysis Project - This project involves using analytics to gain insights into the credit card industry, specifically focusing on areas of bankruptcy, fraud, and collections, as well as responding to customer requests for help with proactive offers and service. The data available includes customer acquisition details, credit card spend for each customer, and repayment details. The project involves cleaning and manipulating the data to answer specific questions related to customer behavior, such as identifying distinct customers and categories, calculating average monthly spend and repayment, and determining the profit earned by the bank. Additionally, the project includes creating graphs to visually represent trends in spending and analyzing top customers by city, product, and time period. A user-defined Python function is also developed to identify the top 10 customers for each city based on their repayment amounts for different products and time periods. 



Project 3 – Pharmaceutical Sales Trend Analysis: A Data Visualization Project - The objective of this data visualization project is to analyze the sales trend of a pharmaceutical company over two years and provide insights that can support decision-making. The data includes sales, units sold, and customer segments, and is analyzed using various techniques such as grouping, reshaping, and visualizing. The project answers questions such as comparing sales by region, identifying contributing factors to sales, comparing sales across regions and tiers, identifying declining trends, and comparing quarter-wise sales. The project demonstrates how data visualization can help decision-makers grasp complex data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions.



Project 4 – Exploring Factors Affecting Loan Interest Rates and Lengths: A Hypothesis Testing Analysis - The goal of this project is to use data from the Lending Club,a peer-to-peer lending site, to test several hypotheses related to factors affecting loan interest rates, loan length, loan purpose, and FICO scores. The available data includes information on loan amounts, interest rates, loan lengths, loan purposes, debt-to-income ratios, states of residence, home ownership status, monthly incomes, FICO scores, open credit lines, revolving credit balances, inquiries in the last 6 months, and employment lengths. The project will leverage hypothesis testing using statistical tests to analyze the relationships between these variables and test the hypotheses.
